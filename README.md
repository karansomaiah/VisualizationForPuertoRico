# VisualizationForPuertoRico
I've created visualizations in D3 to look at the trends relating to different 'Resources' currently in Puerto Rico.

I fetched the data from [@majohansson](https://github.com/majohansson/maria-puerto-rico), who has been scraping and recording data regarding similar resources.

These are two simple charts which show trends in the month of October relating to:
  1. Hospitals  with Electricty
  2. People in shelters

The data tracks the progress of the wonderful country after being hit by serious hurricanes.
